EDI payments update : Script #285 is there on KPI Utils. There I have used second last column for current DPD and last column for Amount Pending. Please check file before uploading.

Written OFF : Script #287 is there on KPI Utils. Last column is used for updating payments. File format has not changed yet. But still keep a check.
