payments update script is for BNPL and NORMAL. If PO paid file is shared, do changed accordingly.

In case of new allocations :
  - BNPL and NORMAL :  columns are all already sorted, just add mandatory columns for our platform.
  - PM and PO : follow the script, rename columns and check for due date with Ops team (sometimes they mention otherwise its Maturity Date)
